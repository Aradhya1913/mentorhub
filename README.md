# mentorhub
Interface That categorises the Mentors' data

The plan is to use PERN stack \
P -> PostgreSQL || for data storage, read, write or MongoDB is also good to go \
E -> Express || middleware to connect the FrontEnd with BackEnd ( a framework of node ) \
R -> React Js || Frontend with css \
N -> Node Js || Backend activities

Group of 4:
1. React + Css
2. PostgreSql
3. Node js + Express js
4. Express js + Axios(api fetch) ( to handle http requests from React to Node js)

Use github to save the progress so that everyone can know others progress
Can git to make a sub branch with team members names & each can build upon that
Make sure to often merge the branches to check the working of integration
